The client app should be able to submit JSON data to the server,
receive a response containing a CSV-formatted result (the way this
is done will vary depending on where you are in the challenge).

Implement all the report generation logic on the server.
Do not use any external libraries (such as via npm). You
may use jQuery on the client.
